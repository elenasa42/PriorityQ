# PriorityQueue
Priority Queues are an extension of queues.

Certain properties that priority queues follow:

- Every item has a priority associated with it.
- Elements with high priority are dequeued before the ones with lower priority.
- Elements with the same priority are served according to their order in the queue.

This priority queue supports the following operations:

insert(item) : Inserts an item

getMax() : Deletes root element
